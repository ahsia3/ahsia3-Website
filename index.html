			<h2 class="about_me">About Me</h2>
			<p class="about_me">Hi! I'm Anthony Hsia - currently 21 years young and from Atlanta, Georgia. I love to design my own website, improve on them, learn new things and apply them. I love to play video games competitively or non-competitively with friends. </p>
			
			<h2 class="about_me">E-Sports at GSU</h2> 
			<p class="about_me"> My e-sports career at GSU started when GSU built the CMII (Creative Media Institute) building in 2017. This new building created many opportunities with new majors/minors such as Game Design & Development and the rise of e-sports at Georgia State University. In 2017, there were three GSU e-sports teams: League of Legends, Smite, and Brawlhalla. If you were on the main roster on one of those teams, you will get a $1K scholarship. I joined the Smite Varsity team being not on the main roster but as a substitute for the role of Support. This first-year Smite roster proved to be strong and won numerous first place titles including the GEL State Champions for both Smite & Paladins as well as the Southern Regionals for Smite. 
			<br><br>
			Continuing onto the year for 2018-2019, two new teams were added to the mix: Paladins and Overwatch. For Smite, there were roster changes as some left and some had joined, and I was promoted onto the main roster of the Smite team for the role of Support. I did also try out for Paladins and got onto the starting roster, however, due to the decision made by higher-ups for scholarships could only go to one-team and not multiple teams (for example if you are on two Varsity teams, you can only get a max of $1K scholarship and not $2K), I volunteered to step-down and hand another person the scholarship. For Smite, the first half of the season was a bit shaky but eventually found our groove with more first-place titles at PantherLan and a fourth place finish for NACE Gem Cup. 
			<br><br>
			Because of CMII, I have made wonderful memories in my last years of my college e-sports career. I would have never met my teammates - my friends - if I didn't take on this opportunity, and I am glad that I did. To my friends that I made who supported me to all the staff of e-sports at GSU, Thank You.
